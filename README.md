# Global Renewable Energy Transition Analysis

## Description
Our project uses data from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and Global Carbon Project (GCP) to analyze global trends in renewable energy adoption, energy generation patterns, and the pace of the transition from fossil fuels.
We aim to clarify our progress in reducing fossil fuel reliance and carbon emissions. By analyzing energy generation patterns, we can evaluate the effectiveness of global and regional policies in promoting renewables and curbing greenhouse gas emissions. This information can be used by policymakers to implement more effective and targeted carbon reduction policies.   

## Project Goals
To address key questions like:
- Are there notable changes in energy generation patterns over the years?
- What renewable energy sources are leading the transition?
- How do countries differ in their pace of adoption?
- Is there any reduction in fossil fuel consumption/carbon emissions globally or within different countries(territorial emissions)?
- How does investment in renewable energy vary across regions/countries? 
- Which emerging renewable energy technologies show the most promise for widespread adoption?
- Is the growth in renewable energy generation keeping pace with the growth in overall energy demand?

## Datasets Used
- **irena_electstats_country.csv**: Country-level energy statistics
- **irena_electstats_region.csv**: Regional energy data
