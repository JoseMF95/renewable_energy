# Introduction
we are doing a project about carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. 
In the face of an escalating climate crisis, the need to transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy has become a critical focus worldwide. Governments, industries, and individuals are seeking solutions to mitigate climate change by reshaping energy generation patterns and reducing carbon emissions. As a result, understanding the progression, effectiveness, and pace of this energy transition has become more and more important. In our final project, we will dive deeper to explore these dynamics.

To achieve this, we utilize a diverse range of datasets from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and Global Carbon Project (GCP). We will analyze historical and regional energy statistics, financing data for renewable projects, and emissions statistics. These datasets enable us to assess the historical progression of energy generation technologies, determine which renewable energy sources are expanding the fastest, and analyze regional differences in the speed and nature of the transition to renewable energy. 

Our project will explore the status and pace of the global renewable energy transition. We aim to clarify our progress in reducing fossil fuel reliance and carbon emissions. By analyzing energy generation patterns, we can evaluate the effectiveness of global and regional policies in promoting renewables and curbing greenhouse gas emissions. This information can be used by policymakers to implement more effective and targeted carbon reduction policies.
